# About

I am a final year Ph.D. candidate researching Natural Language Processing at the University of Waterloo. I work with [Ming Li](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=oGgPXFEAAAAJ&hl=en) on language modeling and unsupervised machine learning methods. Before that, I worked with [Chengqing Zong](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=l8lvKOQAAAAJ&hl=en) on spoken language understanding during my master's study.

In general, my research investigates how to represent language for computing. Lately, I am obsessed with language modeling which represents language via neural computing for its unsupervised and task-agnostic nature. I am also interested in multilingual problems and acoustic sequence modeling.

My thesis concerns modeling text and speech sequences to achieve lower perplexity, better generation, and benefit downstream language tasks; specifically, we address the problem of modeling text and text-speech sequences with Transformer-based language models. My favorite works during my Ph.D. study are [Segment-Aware Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14996), [Hypernym-Instructed Language Modeling](arxiv.org/abs/2203.10692), and [Alignment-Aware Acoustic and Text Modeling](arxiv.org/abs/2203.09690).
